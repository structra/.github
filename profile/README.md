# Welcome to structra 🌐

## 🚀 Our Vision

As students our first goal is to have fun in our projects and improve upon ourselves.
Nonetheless we also want to provide clean, maintainable and performant code that is actually used.
To that end, we hope some of you reading this might get some use out of our repositories. 👍

`Motivation drives development!`
